# EmpiricalRisks

This Julia package provides a collection of predictors and loss functions, mainly to support the implementation of (regularized) empirical risk minimization methods.

**Test Status:**
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lindahua/EmpiricalRisks.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lindahua/EmpiricalRisks.jl)
[![EmpiricalRisks](http://pkg.julialang.org/badges/EmpiricalRisks_0.3.svg)](http://pkg.julialang.org/?pkg=EmpiricalRisks&ver=0.3)
[![EmpiricalRisks](http://pkg.julialang.org/badges/EmpiricalRisks_0.4.svg)](http://pkg.julialang.org/?pkg=EmpiricalRisks&ver=0.4)

Currently, the following higher-level packages are depending on *EmpiricalRisks*:

- [Regression:](https://github.com/lindahua/Regression.jl) solving moderate-size problem using conventional optimization techniques.
- [SGDOptim:](https://github.com/lindahua/SGDOptim.jl) solving large-scale problem using stochastic gradient descent or its variants.


## Overview

This package provides basic components for implementing regularized empirical risk minimization:

![regerm](imgs/regerm.png)

- **Prediction models** ``u = f(x; Î¸)``

  - [x] linear prediction
  - [x] affine prediction
  - [x] multivariate linear prediction
  - [x] multivariate affine prediction

- **Loss functions** ``loss(u, y)``

  - [x] squared loss
  - [x] absolute loss
  - [x] quantile loss
  - [x] huber loss
  - [x] epsilon insensitive loss
  - [x] hinge loss
  - [x] squared hinge loss
  - [x] smoothed hinge loss
  - [x] quadratically smoothed hinge loss
  - [x] modified huber loss
  - [x] logistic loss
  - [x] sum squared loss (for multivariate prediction)
  - [x] multinomial logistic loss

  **Notes:**

  - For each loss function, we provide methods to compute the loss value, the derivative/gradient, or both (at the same time).
  - For each (consistent) combination of loss function and prediction model (which together are referred to as a *risk model*), we provide methods to compute the total risk and the gradient *w.r.t.* the parameter.


- **Regularizers**  

  - [x] squared L2
  - [x] L1
  - [x] elastic net (L1 + squared L2)

  **Notes:**

  - For each regularizer, we provide methods to evaluate the regularization value, the gradient, and the proximal operator.


**Remarks:** All functions in this package are carefully optimized and tested.
